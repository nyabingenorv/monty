# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO A Monty Interpreter written in C (ALX)

`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty`


- Monty 0.98 a scripting language that is compiled into Monty byte codes.
- It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it.
- In this project I create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

## Opcodes
* `push` adds an element to the stack.
* `pop` removes the top element of the stack.
* `pint` prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.
* `add` adds the top two elements of the stack.
* `pall` prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.
* `swap` swaps the top two elements of the stack.
